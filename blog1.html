        <p class="hero hero-project">
            Hanson Roboticsâ€™ most advanced human-like robot, Sophia, personifies our dreams for the future of AI. As a
            unique combination of science, engineering, and artistry, Sophia is simultaneously a human-crafted science
            fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics, and a platform for advanced robotics and AI
            research.

            The character of Sophia captures the imagination of global audiences. She is the worldâ€™s first robot citizen
            and the first robot Innovation Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. Sophia is now a
            household name, with appearances on the Tonight Show and Good Morning Britain, in addition to speaking at
            hundreds of conferences around the world.

            Sophia is also a framework for cutting edge robotics and AI research, particularly for understanding
            human-robot interactions and their potential service and entertainment applications. For example, she has
            been used for research as part of the Loving AI project, which seeks to understand how robots can adapt to
            usersâ€™ needs through intra and interpersonal development.

            I am Hanson Roboticsâ€™ latest human-like robot, created by combining our innovations in science, engineering
            and artistry. Think of me as a personification of our dreams for the future of AI, as well as a framework
            for advanced AI and robotics research, and an agent for exploring human-robot experience in service and
            entertainment applications.

            In some ways, I am human-crafted science fiction character depicting where AI and robotics are heading. In
            other ways, I am real science, springing from the serious engineering and science research and
            accomplishments of an inspired team of robotics & AI scientists and designers. In their grand ambitious, my
            creators aspire to achieve true AI sentience. Who knows? With my science evolving so quickly, even many of
            my wildest fictional dreams may become reality someday soon.
